= Steam

One of the pre-installed applications in the default Wolf configuration is Steam.
Getting Steam to work in a headless container took some work, so this page lists some limitations
and tips to get the most out of Steam.

== Directly launch a Steam game ==

In order to directly launch a Steam game from Moonlight you can just copy the existing `[[apps]]` entry for Steam, change the name and just add the Steam app ID as env variable; example:

[source,toml]
....
[[apps]]
title = "Elden Ring"
start_virtual_compositor = true

[apps.runner]
env = [
  "PROTON_LOG=1",
  "RUN_SWAY=true",
  "GOW_REQUIRED_DEVICES=/dev/input/* /dev/dri/* /dev/nvidia*",
  "STEAM_STARTUP_FLAGS=steam://rungameid/1245620"
]
# COPY EVERYTHING ELSE ...
....

You can get the app ID from https://steamdb.info/[]

== MangoHud ==

The steam overlay currently does not work in our headless container.
So if you want to see FPS and other stats you can use FlightlessMango's excellent https://github.com/flightlessmango/MangoHud[MangoHud].

=== Proton (Steam Play) and other Vulkan games ===

It's already installed and enabled in the default steam image for all Vulkan games (including Proton games).

See below for how to activate it in game.

=== OpenGL (Native Linux) games ===

While mangohud is already installed, there's no way to globally enable it for all OpenGL games.
You can still enable it on a per-game basis by adding `mangohud %command%` to the game's launch options in Steam.

=== Activation and configuration ===

In a game, you can press `Right Shift` + `F12` to make the overlay appear and disappear.
You can also press `Right Shift` + `F11` to change the position of the overlay on screen.
